## Optimization Notes

All images should be optimized for web delivery:
- Use appropriate formats (WebP, JPEG, PNG)
- Compress images to reduce file size
- Include alt text for accessibility
- Use responsive images where appropriate

- Hero section: Large truck/logistics image
- Service cards: Relevant service icons
- Team photos: Professional headshots
- Company story: Office/warehouse images
- Testimonials: Customer photos (optional)
